# isethdrsensor

This repository includes functions and scripts used to evaluate HDR imaging sensor architectures, particularly for nighttime driving scenes.

Code depends on ISETCam, ISETAuto, and ISET3d.

The scripts use HDR night time driving scenes, and simulate the responses to various ISETCam sensors.  We are particularly focused on RGBW and an Omnivision 3-capture sensor. The work here will be described in a paper, in preparation, entitled "ISETHDR: A Physically Accurate Synthetic Radiance Dataset for
High Dynamic Range Nighttime Driving".   The scripts used to create most of the figures in that paper are in this repository.
