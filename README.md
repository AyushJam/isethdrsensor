Test ideas about sensor architectures for HDR imaging

Code relies on ISETCam, ISETAuto, and ISET3d.

These are scripts use HDR night time driving scenes with RGB, RGBW, imx490 (large/small photodetector) and burst photography comparisons.

We will evaluate sensor performance quantitatively (e.g., SNR) and also as inputs to simple object identification networks, such as YOLO.
